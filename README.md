# Shopping List
This is a mod for Old Market Simulator by Alcedo Games.

Created by yasenfire

### v0.2.0

- Slightly lower demand drop on items above recommended price (20% margin to decimate sales instead of 10%), slightly higher demand increase on discounted items (8 times the sales for half recommended price).
- Fixed an important bug that was preventing fish to appear when checking items and there is now generally less clunky item placement.
- Normal buyers have slightly increased chance to buy more items of one kind (more items come in a crate higher the chance is).

## Description

This mod expands limit of items sold per customer to 24 items and adds different customer behaviors.

- 1% of all customers will be obsessed customers, deeply in need of some specific good. They can buy a whole crate of what they need, assuming you have it in your market.
- 20% of all customers will be loyal visitors. For some reason they consider it their duty to buy at your place. Maybe they're your relatives. The more different items you seel, the more they will be able to buy at once.
- All the rest will have the shopping list with things they need. If your market doesn't have at least half of items in the list, they won't even bother with visiting.

Item demand is affected by current season, events and price.

This is early in development, consider to backup your saves before trying.
