## Description

This mod expands limit of items sold per customer to 24 items and adds different customer behaviors.

- 1% of all customers will be obsessed customers, deeply in need of some specific good. They can buy a whole crate of what they need, assuming you have it in your market.
- 20% of all customers will be loyal visitors. For some reason they consider it their duty to buy at your place. Maybe they're your relatives. The more different items you seel, the more they will be able to buy at once.
- All the rest will have the shopping list with things they need. If your market doesn't have at least half of items in the list, they won't even bother with visiting.

This is early in development, consider to backup your saves before trying.
